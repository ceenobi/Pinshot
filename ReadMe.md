# Pinshot - Pinterest like app

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this application.

**This was created using the MERN Stack.**

## The site
Pinshot is my Pinterest inspired attempt at trying to do something similar.

## Building your project

Feel free to use. Below is the process to get the project running:

1. Cloudinary account.
2. Mongo db account.
3. Brevo.
4. Server env files - MONGODB_URI , ACCESS_TOKEN_PRIVATE_KEY, HOST, USERNAME, PASS, SERVICE, BREVOMAILKEY, PORT.
5. Client env files - VITE_APP_BASE_URL, VITE_CLOUDINARY_URL, VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET.
6. Once you fill up with your own keys, start the project on your local machine.
